Enhance the aesthetic curb appeal of your lovely abode with the Keystone Signature Series Mailbox. Intricately crafted, the Keystone SignatureSeries Mailbox is constructed from rust-proof aluminum. Available in a variety of finish and accent combinations and options, the Keystone Signature Series Mailbox instantly adds distinct charm to your home as it features a stunning, raised solid brass &quot;US Mail&quot; lettering.

A five-stage, powder-coated paint process is utilized to ensure that the Keystone Mailbox is quality-wise consistent, durable, and possess a high-quality finish. Powder coating has ultraviolet ray (UV) inhibitors that protect the surfaces, making the finish resistant to chipping, scratching, fading, and wearing.

<ul>
<li>Almond</li>

Add a touch of class and elegance to your lovely abode with a Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque. This beautiful plaque features one to three decorative and stunning raised house numbers made from solid brass. Customize with a variety of finishes, frame and brass number combinations to bring out your home's unique identity. </p>
<p><strong> Metal and Finish</strong><br />
The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque is constructed from durable A360 rust-proof cast aluminum. Extremely sturdy and light-weight at the same time, cast aluminum is 100% rust-resistant. It is formed by pouring aluminum into a mold of the end product. During the manufacturing process, the aluminum goes under substantial amounts of pressure, which produces an extremely dense material that can withstand the harshest of conditions.</p>
<p>A five-stage, powder-coated paint process is utilized to ensure that the Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque is quality-wise consistent, durable, and possess a high-quality finish. Powder coating has ultraviolet ray (UV) inhibitors that protect the surfaces, making the finish resistant to chipping, scratching, fading, and wearing. Colors remain bright and vibrant for the longest time. The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque is available in the following elegant finishes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Classic black </li>
<li>Classic white </li>
<li>Classic Bronze </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Styles</strong><br />
The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque comes in two   styles. A conventional styled plaque features a frame that matches the finish. For a more stylish look, an optional decorative frame accent is available. This accent is crafted from solid brass and comes in four different finishes: Polished Brass, Antique Bronze, Satin nickel, or Verde Brass. </p>
<p><strong>Raised Address Numbers</strong><br />
The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque features stunning raised numbers that exude elegance and sophistication. Crafted from solid brass, each number casts a soft shadow across the plaque which adds depth and unmistakable character. They come in four frame finishes: Polished Brass, Antique Bronze, Satin Nickel, or Verde   Brass. The plaque holds one to three of these ornate 3 1/2&rdquo; tall house numbers. Regular basic cleaning will keep them looking new for   many years. With all three available plaque colors, two different frame   styles and house number finishes, you have a total of 24 beautiful combinations to choose from. </p>

This beautiful plaque features one to three decorative and stunning raised house numbers made from solid brass. Customize with a variety of finishes, frame and brass number combinations to bring out your home's unique identity. </p>
<p><strong> Metal and Finish</strong><br />
The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque is constructed from durable A360 rust-proof cast aluminum. Extremely sturdy and light-weight at the same time, cast aluminum is 100% rust-resistant. It is formed by pouring aluminum into a mold of the end product. During the manufacturing process, the aluminum goes under substantial amounts of pressure, which produces an extremely dense material that can withstand the harshest of conditions.</p>
<p>A five-stage, powder-coated paint process is utilized to ensure that the Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque is quality-wise consistent, durable, and possess a high-quality finish. Powder coating has ultraviolet ray (UV) inhibitors that protect the surfaces, making the finish resistant to chipping, scratching, fading, and wearing. Colors remain bright and vibrant for the longest time. The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque is available in the following elegant finishes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Classic black </li>
<li>Classic white </li>
<li>Classic Bronze </li>

For a more stylish look, an optional decorative frame accent is available. This accent is crafted from solid brass and comes in four different finishes: Polished Brass, Antique Bronze, Satin nickel, or Verde Brass. </p>
<p><strong>Raised Address Numbers</strong><br />
The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque features stunning raised numbers that exude elegance and sophistication. Crafted from solid brass, each number casts a soft shadow across the plaque which adds depth and unmistakable character. They come in four frame finishes: Polished Brass, Antique Bronze, Satin Nickel, or Verde   Brass. The plaque holds one to three of these ornate 3 1/2&rdquo; tall house numbers. Regular basic cleaning will keep them looking new for   many years.

Add a touch of class and elegance to your lovely abode with a Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque. This beautiful plaque features one to three decorative and stunning raised house numbers made from solid brass. Customize with a variety of finishes, frame and brass number combinations to bring out your home's unique identity. </p>
<p><strong> Metal and Finish</strong><br />
The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque is constructed from durable A360 rust-proof cast aluminum. Extremely sturdy and light-weight at the same time, cast aluminum is 100% rust-resistant. It is formed by pouring aluminum into a mold of the end product. During the manufacturing process, the aluminum goes under substantial amounts of pressure, which produces an extremely dense material that can withstand the harshest of conditions.</p>
<p>A five-stage, powder-coated paint process is utilized to ensure that the Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque is quality-wise consistent, durable, and possess a high-quality finish. Powder coating has ultraviolet ray (UV) inhibitors that protect the surfaces, making the finish resistant to chipping, scratching, fading, and wearing. Colors remain bright and vibrant for the longest time. The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque is available in the following elegant finishes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Classic black </li>
<li>Classic white </li>
<li>Classic Bronze </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Styles</strong><br />
The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque comes in two styles. A conventional styled plaque features a frame that matches the finish. For a more stylish look, an optional decorative frame accent is available. This accent is crafted from solid brass and comes in four different finishes: Polished Brass, Antique Bronze, Satin nickel, or Verde Brass. </p>
<p><strong>Raised Address Numbers</strong><br />
The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque features stunning raised numbers that exude elegance and sophistication. Crafted from solid brass, each number casts a soft shadow across the plaque which adds depth and unmistakable character. They come in four frame finishes: Polished Brass, Antique Bronze, Satin Nickel, or Verde   Brass. The plaque holds one to three of these ornate 3 1/2&rdquo; tall house numbers. Regular basic cleaning will keep them looking new for   many years. With all three available plaque colors, two different frame styles and house number finishes, you have a total of 24 beautiful combinations to choose from. </p>

Powder coating has ultraviolet ray (UV) inhibitors that protect the surfaces, making the finish resistant to chipping, scratching, fading, and wearing. Colors remain bright and vibrant for the longest time. The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque is available in the following elegant finishes:</p>

Add a touch of class and elegance to your lovely abode with a Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque. This beautiful plaque features one to five decorative and stunning raised house numbers made from solid brass. Customize with a variety of finishes, frame and brass number combinations to bring out your home's unique identity. </p>
<p><strong> Metal and Finish</strong><br />
The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque is constructed from durable A360 rust-proof cast aluminum. Extremely sturdy and light-weight at the same time, cast aluminum is 100% rust-resistant. It is formed by pouring aluminum into a mold of the end product. During the manufacturing process, the aluminum goes under substantial amounts of pressure, which produces an extremely dense material that can withstand the harshest of conditions.</p>
<p>A five-stage, powder-coated paint process is utilized to ensure that the Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque is quality-wise consistent, durable, and possess a high-quality finish. Powder coating has ultraviolet ray (UV) inhibitors that protect the surfaces, making the finish resistant to chipping, scratching, fading, and wearing. Colors remain bright and vibrant for the longest time. The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque is available in the following elegant finishes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Classic black </li>
<li>Classic white </li>
<li>Classic Bronze </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Styles</strong><br />
The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque comes in two styles. A conventional styled plaque features a frame that matches the finish. For a more stylish look, an optional decorative frame accent is available. This accent is crafted from solid brass and comes in four different finishes: Polished Brass, Antique Bronze, Satin nickel, or Verde Brass. </p>
<p><strong>Raised Address Numbers</strong><br />
The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque features stunning raised numbers that exude elegance and sophistication. Crafted from solid brass, each number casts a soft shadow across the plaque which adds depth and unmistakable character. They come in four frame finishes: Polished Brass, Antique Bronze, Satin Nickel, or Verde   Brass. The plaque holds one to five of these ornate 3 1/2&rdquo; tall house numbers. Regular basic cleaning will keep them looking new for   many years. With all three available plaque colors, two different frame styles and house number finishes, you have a total of 24 beautiful combinations to choose from. </p>

Powder coating has ultraviolet ray (UV) inhibitors that protect the surfaces, making the finish resistant to chipping, scratching, fading, and wearing. Colors remain bright and vibrant for the longest time. The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque is available in the following elegant finishes:</p>

Add a touch of class and elegance to your lovely abode with a Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque. This beautiful plaque features one to five decorative and stunning raised house numbers made from solid brass. Customize with a variety of finishes, frame and brass number combinations to bring out your home's unique identity. </p>
<p><strong> Metal and Finish</strong><br />
The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque is constructed from durable A360 rust-proof cast aluminum. Extremely sturdy and light-weight at the same time, cast aluminum is 100% rust-resistant. It is formed by pouring aluminum into a mold of the end product. During the manufacturing process, the aluminum goes under substantial amounts of pressure, which produces an extremely dense material that can withstand the harshest of conditions.</p>
<p>A five-stage, powder-coated paint process is utilized to ensure that the Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque is quality-wise consistent, durable, and possess a high-quality finish. Powder coating has ultraviolet ray (UV) inhibitors that protect the surfaces, making the finish resistant to chipping, scratching, fading, and wearing. Colors remain bright and vibrant for the longest time. The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque is available in the following elegant finishes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Classic black </li>
<li>Classic white </li>
<li>Classic Bronze </li>

For a more stylish look, an optional decorative frame accent is available. This accent is crafted from solid brass and comes in four different finishes: Polished Brass, Antique Bronze, Satin nickel, or Verde Brass. </p>
<p><strong>Raised Address Numbers</strong><br />
The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque features stunning raised numbers that exude elegance and sophistication. Crafted from solid brass, each number casts a soft shadow across the plaque which adds depth and unmistakable character. They come in four frame finishes: Polished Brass, Antique Bronze, Satin Nickel, or Verde   Brass. The plaque holds one to five of these ornate 3 1/2&rdquo; tall house numbers. Regular basic cleaning will keep them looking new for   many years. With all three available plaque colors, two different frame styles and house number finishes, you have a total of 24 beautiful combinations to choose from. </p>

Customize with a variety of finishes, frame and brass number combinations to bring out your home's unique identity. </p>
<p><strong> Metal and Finish</strong><br />
The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque is constructed from durable A360 rust-proof cast aluminum. Extremely sturdy and light-weight at the same time, cast aluminum is 100% rust-resistant.

<p>A five-stage, powder-coated paint process is utilized to ensure that the Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque is quality-wise consistent, durable, and possess a high-quality finish. Powder coating has ultraviolet ray (UV) inhibitors that protect the surfaces, making the finish resistant to chipping, scratching, fading, and wearing. Colors remain bright and vibrant for the longest time. The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque is available in the following elegant finishes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Classic black </li>

Add a touch of class and elegance to your lovely abode with a Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque. This beautiful plaque features one to three decorative and stunning raised house numbers made from solid brass. Customize with a variety of finishes, frame and brass number combinations to bring out your home's unique identity. </p>
<p><strong> Metal and Finish</strong><br />
The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque is constructed from durable A360 rust-proof cast aluminum. Extremely sturdy and light-weight at the same time, cast aluminum is 100% rust-resistant. It is formed by pouring aluminum into a mold of the end product. During the manufacturing process, the aluminum goes under substantial amounts of pressure, which produces an extremely dense material that can withstand the harshest of conditions.</p>
<p>A five-stage, powder-coated paint process is utilized to ensure that the Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque is quality-wise consistent, durable, and possess a high-quality finish. Powder coating has ultraviolet ray (UV) inhibitors that protect the surfaces, making the finish resistant to chipping, scratching, fading, and wearing. Colors remain bright and vibrant for the longest time. The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque is available in the following elegant finishes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Classic black </li>
<li>Classic white </li>
<li>Classic Bronze </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Styles</strong><br />

For a more stylish look, an optional decorative frame accent is available. This accent is crafted from solid brass and comes in four different finishes: Polished Brass, Antique Bronze, Satin nickel, or Verde Brass. </p>
<p><strong>Raised Address Numbers</strong><br />
The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque features stunning raised numbers that exude elegance and sophistication. Crafted from solid brass, each number casts a soft shadow across the plaque which adds depth and unmistakable character. They come in four frame finishes: Polished Brass, Antique Bronze, Satin Nickel, or Verde   Brass. The plaque holds one to three of these ornate 3 1/2&rdquo; tall house numbers. Regular basic cleaning will keep them looking new for   many years. With all three available plaque colors, two different frame   styles and house number finishes, you have a total of 24 beautiful combinations to choose from. </p>

Powder coating has ultraviolet ray (UV) inhibitors that protect the surfaces, making the finish resistant to chipping, scratching, fading, and wearing. Colors remain bright and vibrant for the longest time. The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque is available in the following elegant finishes:</p>

Add a touch of class and elegance to your lovely abode with a Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque. This beautiful plaque features one to three decorative and stunning raised house numbers made from solid brass. Customize with a variety of finishes, frame and brass number combinations to bring out your home's unique identity. </p>
<p><strong> Metal and Finish</strong><br />
The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque is constructed from durable A360 rust-proof cast aluminum. Extremely sturdy and light-weight at the same time, cast aluminum is 100% rust-resistant. It is formed by pouring aluminum into a mold of the end product. During the manufacturing process, the aluminum goes under substantial amounts of pressure, which produces an extremely dense material that can withstand the harshest of conditions.</p>
<p>A five-stage, powder-coated paint process is utilized to ensure that the Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque is quality-wise consistent, durable, and possess a high-quality finish. Powder coating has ultraviolet ray (UV) inhibitors that protect the surfaces, making the finish resistant to chipping, scratching, fading, and wearing. Colors remain bright and vibrant for the longest time. The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque is available in the following elegant finishes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Classic black </li>
<li>Classic white </li>
<li>Classic Bronze </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Styles</strong><br />
The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque comes in two styles. A conventional styled plaque features a frame that matches the finish. For a more stylish look, an optional decorative frame accent is available. This accent is crafted from solid brass and comes in four different finishes: Polished Brass, Antique Bronze, Satin nickel, or Verde Brass. </p>
<p><strong>Raised Address Numbers</strong><br />
The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque features stunning raised numbers that exude elegance and sophistication. Crafted from solid brass, each number casts a soft shadow across the plaque which adds depth and unmistakable character. They come in four frame finishes: Polished Brass, Antique Bronze, Satin Nickel, or Verde   Brass. The plaque holds one to three of these ornate 3 1/2&rdquo; tall house numbers. Regular basic cleaning will keep them looking new for   many years. With all three available plaque colors, two different frame styles and house number finishes, you have a total of 24 beautiful combinations to choose from. </p>

<p>A five-stage, powder-coated paint process is utilized to ensure that the Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque is quality-wise consistent, durable, and possess a high-quality finish. Powder coating has ultraviolet ray (UV) inhibitors that protect the surfaces, making the finish resistant to chipping, scratching, fading, and wearing. Colors remain bright and vibrant for the longest time. The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque is available in the following elegant finishes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Classic black </li>

Add a touch of class and elegance to your lovely abode with a Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque. This beautiful plaque features one to five decorative and stunning raised house numbers made from solid brass. Customize with a variety of finishes, frame and brass number combinations to bring out your home's unique identity. </p>
<p><strong> Metal and Finish</strong><br />
The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque is constructed from durable A360 rust-proof cast aluminum. Extremely sturdy and light-weight at the same time, cast aluminum is 100% rust-resistant. It is formed by pouring aluminum into a mold of the end product. During the manufacturing process, the aluminum goes under substantial amounts of pressure, which produces an extremely dense material that can withstand the harshest of conditions.</p>
<p>A five-stage, powder-coated paint process is utilized to ensure that the Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque is quality-wise consistent, durable, and possess a high-quality finish. Powder coating has ultraviolet ray (UV) inhibitors that protect the surfaces, making the finish resistant to chipping, scratching, fading, and wearing. Colors remain bright and vibrant for the longest time. The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque is available in the following elegant finishes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Classic black </li>
<li>Classic white </li>
<li>Classic Bronze </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Styles</strong><br />
The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque comes in two   styles. A conventional styled plaque features a frame that matches the finish. For a more stylish look, an optional decorative frame accent is available. This accent is crafted from solid brass and comes in four different finishes: Polished Brass, Antique Bronze, Satin nickel, or Verde Brass. </p>
<p><strong>Raised Address Numbers</strong><br />
The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque features stunning raised numbers that exude elegance and sophistication. Crafted from solid brass, each number casts a soft shadow across the plaque which adds depth and unmistakable character. They come in four frame finishes: Polished Brass, Antique Bronze, Satin Nickel, or Verde   Brass. The plaque holds one to five of these ornate 3 1/2&rdquo; tall house numbers. Regular basic cleaning will keep them looking new for   many years. With all three available plaque colors, two different frame   styles and house number finishes, you have a total of 24 beautiful combinations to choose from. </p>

This beautiful plaque features one to five decorative and stunning raised house numbers made from solid brass. Customize with a variety of finishes, frame and brass number combinations to bring out your home's unique identity. </p>

The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque is constructed from durable A360 rust-proof cast aluminum. Extremely sturdy and light-weight at the same time, cast aluminum is 100% rust-resistant.

<p>A five-stage, powder-coated paint process is utilized to ensure that the Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque is quality-wise consistent, durable, and possess a high-quality finish. Powder coating has ultraviolet ray (UV) inhibitors that protect the surfaces, making the finish resistant to chipping, scratching, fading, and wearing. Colors remain bright and vibrant for the longest time. The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque is available in the following elegant finishes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Classic black </li>
<li>Classic white </li>

Add a touch of class and elegance to your lovely abode with a Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque. This beautiful plaque features one to five decorative and stunning raised house numbers made from solid brass. Customize with a variety of finishes, frame and brass number combinations to bring out your home's unique identity. </p>
<p><strong> Metal and Finish</strong><br />
The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque is constructed from durable A360 rust-proof cast aluminum. Extremely sturdy and light-weight at the same time, cast aluminum is 100% rust-resistant. It is formed by pouring aluminum into a mold of the end product. During the manufacturing process, the aluminum goes under substantial amounts of pressure, which produces an extremely dense material that can withstand the harshest of conditions.</p>
<p>A five-stage, powder-coated paint process is utilized to ensure that the Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque is quality-wise consistent, durable, and possess a high-quality finish. Powder coating has ultraviolet ray (UV) inhibitors that protect the surfaces, making the finish resistant to chipping, scratching, fading, and wearing. Colors remain bright and vibrant for the longest time. The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque is available in the following elegant finishes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Classic black </li>
<li>Classic white </li>
<li>Classic Bronze </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Styles</strong><br />

For a more stylish look, an optional decorative frame accent is available. This accent is crafted from solid brass and comes in four different finishes: Polished Brass, Antique Bronze, Satin nickel, or Verde Brass. </p>
<p><strong>Raised Address Numbers</strong><br />
The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque features stunning raised numbers that exude elegance and sophistication. Crafted from solid brass, each number casts a soft shadow across the plaque which adds depth and unmistakable character. They come in four frame finishes: Polished Brass, Antique Bronze, Satin Nickel, or Verde   Brass. The plaque holds one to five of these ornate 3 1/2&rdquo; tall house numbers. Regular basic cleaning will keep them looking new for   many years. With all three available plaque colors, two different frame styles and house number finishes, you have a total of 24 beautiful combinations to choose from. </p>

Customize with a variety of finishes, frame and brass number combinations to bring out your home's unique identity. </p>
<p><strong> Metal and Finish</strong><br />
The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque is constructed from durable A360 rust-proof cast aluminum. Extremely sturdy and light-weight at the same time, cast aluminum is 100% rust-resistant.

Powder coating has ultraviolet ray (UV) inhibitors that protect the surfaces, making the finish resistant to chipping, scratching, fading, and wearing. Colors remain bright and vibrant for the longest time. The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque is available in the following elegant finishes:</p>

Add a touch of class and elegance to your lovely abode with a Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque. This beautiful plaque features one to three decorative and stunning raised house numbers made from solid brass. Customize with a variety of finishes, frame and brass number combinations to bring out your home's unique identity. </p>
<p><strong> Metal and Finish</strong><br />
The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque is constructed from durable A360 rust-proof cast aluminum. Extremely sturdy and light-weight at the same time, cast aluminum is 100% rust-resistant. It is formed by pouring aluminum into a mold of the end product. During the manufacturing process, the aluminum goes under substantial amounts of pressure, which produces an extremely dense material that can withstand the harshest of conditions.</p>
<p>A five-stage, powder-coated paint process is utilized to ensure that the Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque is quality-wise consistent, durable, and possess a high-quality finish. Powder coating has ultraviolet ray (UV) inhibitors that protect the surfaces, making the finish resistant to chipping, scratching, fading, and wearing. Colors remain bright and vibrant for the longest time. The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque is available in the following elegant finishes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Classic black </li>
<li>Classic white </li>
<li>Classic Bronze </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Styles</strong><br />
The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque comes in two   styles. A conventional styled plaque features a frame that matches the finish. For a more stylish look, an optional decorative frame accent is available. This accent is crafted from solid brass and comes in four different finishes: Polished Brass, Antique Bronze, Satin nickel, or Verde Brass. </p>
<p><strong>Raised Address Numbers</strong><br />
The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque features stunning raised numbers that exude elegance and sophistication. Crafted from solid brass, each number casts a soft shadow across the plaque which adds depth and unmistakable character. They come in four frame finishes: Polished Brass, Antique Bronze, Satin Nickel, or Verde   Brass. The plaque holds one to three of these ornate 3 1/2&rdquo; tall house numbers. Regular basic cleaning will keep them looking new for   many years. With all three available plaque colors, two different frame   styles and house number finishes, you have a total of 24 beautiful combinations to choose from. </p>

Powder coating has ultraviolet ray (UV) inhibitors that protect the surfaces, making the finish resistant to chipping, scratching, fading, and wearing. Colors remain bright and vibrant for the longest time. The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque is available in the following elegant finishes:</p>

Gaines Address Plaques,Gaines Mailboxes,H2-LOWH,Housemark Large Oval Address Plaques White with Brass ,"<p><strong>Gaines HouseMark Large Oval Address Plaques</strong><br />
Add a touch of class and elegance to your lovely abode with a Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque. This beautiful plaque features one to five decorative and stunning raised house numbers made from solid brass. Customize with a variety of finishes, frame and brass number combinations to bring out your home's unique identity. </p>
<p><strong> Metal and Finish</strong><br />
The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque is constructed from durable A360 rust-proof cast aluminum. Extremely sturdy and light-weight at the same time, cast aluminum is 100% rust-resistant. It is formed by pouring aluminum into a mold of the end product. During the manufacturing process, the aluminum goes under substantial amounts of pressure, which produces an extremely dense material that can withstand the harshest of conditions.</p>
<p>A five-stage, powder-coated paint process is utilized to ensure that the Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque is quality-wise consistent, durable, and possess a high-quality finish. Powder coating has ultraviolet ray (UV) inhibitors that protect the surfaces, making the finish resistant to chipping, scratching, fading, and wearing. Colors remain bright and vibrant for the longest time. The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque is available in the following elegant finishes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Classic black </li>
<li>Classic white </li>
<li>Classic Bronze </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Styles</strong><br />
The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque comes in two   styles. A conventional styled plaque features a frame that matches the finish. For a more stylish look, an optional decorative frame accent is available. This accent is crafted from solid brass and comes in four different finishes: Polished Brass, Antique Bronze, Satin nickel, or Verde Brass. </p>
<p><strong>Raised Address Numbers</strong><br />
The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque features stunning raised numbers that exude elegance and sophistication. Crafted from solid brass, each number casts a soft shadow across the plaque which adds depth and unmistakable character. They come in four frame finishes: Polished Brass, Antique Bronze, Satin Nickel, or Verde   Brass. The plaque holds one to five of these ornate 3 1/2&rdquo; tall house numbers. Regular basic cleaning will keep them looking new for   many years. With all three available plaque colors, two different frame   styles and house number finishes, you have a total of 24 beautiful combinations to choose from. </p>

This beautiful plaque features one to five decorative and stunning raised house numbers made from solid brass. Customize with a variety of finishes, frame and brass number combinations to bring out your home's unique identity. </p>

Powder coating has ultraviolet ray (UV) inhibitors that protect the surfaces, making the finish resistant to chipping, scratching, fading, and wearing. Colors remain bright and vibrant for the longest time. The Gaines HouseMark Address Plaque is available in the following elegant finishes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Classic black </li>
<li>Classic white </li>

Gaines Mailboxes,Gaines Mailboxes,KS-6A,Original Keystone Series Mailbox - Forest Green w/ Polished Brass,"<p><strong>About the Keystone Series Mailbox</strong></p>
Enhance the aesthetic curb appeal of your lovely abode with the Keystone Series Mailbox. Intricately crafted, the Keystone Series Mailbox is constructed from rust-proof aluminum. Available in a variety of finish and accent combinations and options, the Keystone Series Mailbox instantly adds distinct charm to your home. 
<p><strong>Cast Aluminum Material</strong></p>
Keystone Mailboxes are constructed from durable A360 rust-proof cast aluminum. Extremely sturdy and light-weight at the same time, cast aluminum is 100% rust-resistant. It is formed by pouring aluminum into a mold of the end product. During the manufacturing process, the aluminum goes under substantial amounts of pressure, which produces an extremely dense material that can withstand the harshest of conditions.
<p><strong>High-Quality Finish</strong></p> 
A five-stage, powder-coated paint process is utilized to ensure that the Keystone Mailbox is quality-wise consistent, durable, and possess a high-quality finish. Powder coating has ultraviolet ray (UV) inhibitors that protect the surfaces, making the finish resistant to chipping, scratching, fading, and wearing. Colors remain bright and vibrant for the longest time. The Keystone Mailbox is available in the following elegant finishes:
<ul>
<li>Almond</li>
<li>Classic Black</li>
<li>Classic White</li>
<li>Metallic Bronze</li>
<li>Metallic Charcoal</li>
<li>Forest Green</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Keystone Series Mailbox Accents</strong></p>
The Keystone Series Mailbox exclusively features a decorative door plaque and flag made from solid brass. You may choose from any of these finishes: Polished Brass, Antique Bronze, Satin Nickel, or Verde Brass. A regular basic cleaning will keep these accents looking new for many years.
<p><strong>The Keystone Series Mailbox Options</strong></p>
A lockable insert option is available for all Keystone Series Mailboxes. No more worries of mail and identity theft! The lock and key are constructed from high grade stainless steel. If you choose this option at the time you place your mailbox order, the lockable insert will be factory installed. 
<p><strong>The Keystone Series Mailbox Customization</strong></p>
Distinguish your home in style by placing vinyl characters in gold, silver or bronze on one or both sides of your Keystone Series Mailbox. The lettering is made from a highly durable premium vinyl and are designed to last over 7 years. If you choose to customize at the time you place your mailbox order, the lettering will be factory installed.

<p><strong>Cast Aluminum Material</strong></p>
Gaines Classic Column Mailboxes are constructed from durable A360 rust-proof cast aluminum. Extremely sturdy and light-weight at the same time, cast aluminum is 100% rust-resistant. It is formed by pouring aluminum into a mold of the end product. During the manufacturing process, the aluminum goes under substantial amounts of pressure, which produces an extremely dense material that can withstand the harshest of conditions.
<p><strong>High-Quality Finish</strong></p> 
A five-stage, powder-coated paint process is utilized to ensure that the Gaines Classic Column Mailbox is quality-wise consistent, durable, and possess a high-quality finish. Powder coating has ultraviolet ray (UV) inhibitors that protect the surfaces, making the finish resistant to chipping, scratching, fading, and wearing. Colors remain bright and vibrant for the longest time. The Gaines Classic Column Mailbox is available in the following elegant finishes:
<ul>
<li>Almond</li>
<li>Classic Black</li>
<li>Classic White</li>
<li>Metallic Bronze</li>
<li>Metallic Charcoal</li>
<li>Forest Green</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Classic Eagle Faceplate</strong></p>
Give your home a touch of good ol' American charm and tradition with the Classic Eagle Faceplate. The faceplate is made from solid brass, bronze, satin nickel or verde brass to withstand the harshest elements. A regular basic cleaning will keep the faceplate looking new for many years. 
<p><strong>Size of the Gaines Classic Column Mailbox</strong></p>
